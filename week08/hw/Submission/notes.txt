Part 1: Image Annotation
1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?
   - I annotated 40 images in 20 minutes.

2. Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?
   - 14 instances of the Millenium Falcon and 47 TIE Fighters

3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?
   - I would randomly select pictures to annotate rather than annotate images in sequence, since images in sequence tended to be similar.

4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?
   - Augmentations could change the dimensions and aspect ratios of the annotations.
