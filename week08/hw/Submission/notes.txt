Part 1: Image Annotation
1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?
   - I annotated 40 images in 20 minutes.

2. Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?
   - 14 instances of the Millenium Falcon and 47 TIE Fighters

3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?
   - I would randomly select pictures to annotate rather than annotate images in sequence, since images in sequence tended to be similar.

4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?
   - Augmentations could change the dimensions and aspect ratios of the annotations.


Part 2: Image Augmentation
1. Describe the following augmentations in your own words
Flip - Flip Horizontal is to mirror along the y-axis while Flip Vertical is to mirroer along the x-axis.
Rotation - Rotate counter-clockwise by given number of degrees.
Scale - Shrink or stretch the image.  Zoom in/out of the image.
Crop - Keep only part of the image.
Translation - Move the image up/down/left/right while maintaining the same size and aspect ratio.
Noise - Inject random (noise) pixels into the image to obscure it.


Part 3: Audio Annotation
1. Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation?
- Audio annotation creates training data for NLP.
